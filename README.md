# joy-format: a python formatter for aligning adjacent assignment expressions
--------------
### Background
Having tried Golang I grew to appreciate the automatic alignment of statements on adjacent lines.
Personally, I find that it makes the code easier to scan and comprehend.

Seeing code formatted in this way brings me joy, so I'm writing a formatter in the hope that I can
use it in some projects of mine. Ideally, it will extend something like `black`'s formatting,
which I by-and-large find to be great.

## Examples
TODO: add examples.

## Installation
TODO upload to pypy etc.

#### Dev-Notes
The `rt` file is meant as a shorthand to  run the tests.
Sort of how some people use a `test` command in their makefiles and invoke `make test`
to run their tests.

If any code is malformatted by this tool, please open an issue with the input and output that you
expected / received and I'll do my best to take a look.
